# pytorch-models-cifar
Pytorch implementations of popular models for CIFAR compatibility. (Most Pytorch models are only compatible with ImageNet resolution images - not 32x32 images) 

To launch training:
`python train.py` 

Supported models: LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet (more to come...). Custom pytorch implementation of models can be found within `cifar-models` folder.
